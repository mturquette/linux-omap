config CPU_OFFLINE
	bool "CPUoffline framework"
	help
	  CPUoffline provides a framework that allows for taking CPUs
	  offline via an in-kernel governor.  The governor itself can
	  implement any number of policies for deciding to offline a
	  core.  Though primarily used for power capping, CPUoffline can
	  also be used to implement a thermal duty to prevent core
	  over-heating, etc.

	  For details please see <file:Documentation/cpuoffline>.

	  If in doubt, say N.
